# Capstone-Project---Week-3
Introduction/Business Problem: To recommend a location in Toronto that is relatively densely populated with offices and is near to transportation. This will likely increase the human traffic which will translate to better business. 

1. Introduction
Ontario has 52 cities with a cumulative population of approximately 9,900,000 and average population of 190,388. The most densely populated city is Toronto with 2,731,571 residents. With such huge population giving rise to a densely populated area, the aim is to locate the restaurant with good human traffic to provide a good chance that the business will give better returns. 

2. Data Description
In this project, I will be using the data available on Wikipedia Link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cities_in_Ontario
This data has provided several information that are crucial to determine the best location to start the restaurant operation. Important information such as population, population density, area size and etc.
